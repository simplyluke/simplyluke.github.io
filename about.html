    <h1>Luke Wright | About me</h1> 
    <p>
      ðŸ‘‹ I'm Luke Wright. I'm a software engineer living in Seattle, Washington. I've worked across many languages and stacks, but building products with web technologies is what I've done the most of and get the most from. I've been coding in some capacity since 2012, when I picked it up as an eager middle-schooler. My writing, and most all of what I do outside of work doesn't reflect the other people I work with.

      In my personal life I'm a very avid skier through the winter, and spend my summers running, climbing, and generally having fun in Washington's mountains.
