title: "Launch: Retool Portals + Embed"
---

This is what I’ve been working on professionally lately, under the umbrella of making Retool work better for more external business software.

I’m not sure how much I plan to write about my professional life, for a variety of reasons, but check out the links to the product pages. I’m proud of the work myself and the rest of my team put in to these products and they’ve been well received by our customers so far.

We launched Portals in beta on July 13, and it also marked the public general availability of Embed. We also hosted a developer day which I got to speak at a bit, which was fun and the first public speaking I've done during my career.
